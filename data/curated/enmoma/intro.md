# English Monarchs and Marriages 

This week we are exploring [English Monarchs and Marriages](https://github.com/frankiethull/english_monarch_marriages)! 

> this dataset focuses on the names, ages, and marriages of various 'kings' and 'consorts'. the data ranges all the way back to 850 where the details are a bit fuzzy, spanning all the way to current day. names contain special characters; ages & years can be a bit of a regex puzzle as well. additionally, the age of kings and consorts may show quite a bit of an age gap. 

The data was scraped from [Ian Visits](https://www.ianvisits.co.uk/articles/a-list-of-monarchs-by-marriage-6857/).
